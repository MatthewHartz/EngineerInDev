    <h2>Why I Created This Blog</h2>
    <div>
        While working at my current job, I would experience difficulties when working with some poorly
        documented issues online. Some of these issues would come up, time and time again. This cycle
        would drive me insane. A lot of these issues weren't anything that a PhD professor would need
        to write his/her thesis on, and I figured I thought this would be a great way to contribute to
        a community that I rely so heavily on when doing my work. The community that wraps itself around
        <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> made me want to give back.
        <br/><br/>
        This blog is currently intended for people, like myself, who are looking for a solution to a problem
        they have run into; and HOPEFULLY I have come across it myself and written up a small tutorial/solution
        on it.
        <br/><br/>
        My goal through this project is to not only get some exposure, some experience, but also develop myself
        as an engineer.

    <h2>Where I Went to School</h2>
    <div>
        I graduated from UCI in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Previously I attended Fullerton College
        which is where I met a handful of friends and professor that got me to find a love/passion for coding.
        I feel like if I didn't originally attend my junior college and meet the people that I did, I probably
        would've ended up as a history major or something.
