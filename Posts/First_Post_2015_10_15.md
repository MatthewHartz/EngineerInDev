### Why I Created This Blog

While working at my current job, I would experience difficulties when working with some poorly documented issues online. Some of these issues would come up, time and time again. This cycle would drive me insane. A lot of these issues weren't anything that a PhD professor would need to write his/her thesis on, and I figured I thought this would be a great way to contribute to a community that I rely so heavily on when doing my work. The community that wraps itself around Stack Overflow made me want to give back. 

This blog is currently intended for people, like myself, who are looking for a solution to a problem they have run into; and HOPEFULLY I have come across it myself and written up a small tutorial/solution on it. 

My goal through this project is to not only get some exposure, some experience, but also develop myself as an engineer.
### Where I Went to School

I graduated from UCI in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Previously I attended Fullerton College which is where I met a handful of friends and professor that got me to find a love/passion for coding. I feel like if I didn't originally attend my junior college and meet the people that I did, I probably would've ended up as a history major or something.
